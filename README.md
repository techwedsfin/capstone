Corona virus trend analysis data science capstone project
Description:- This project analyzes corona virus trends and provides insight on countries impacted by covid, spread trends and future trends in USA.

Installations:-This code runs with Python version 3.x and requires below listed packages 
numpy==1.12.1
pandas==0.23.3
plotly==2.0.15
requests==2.21.0
scikit-learn==0.19.1
plotly==4.5.0
Folium==0.10.1
wget==3.2
Keras==2.0.9

###Project Motivation:-This is an Udacity Nanodegree capstone project. Looking at the current pandamic scenario across the globe i decided to work on this dataset, provide some insights and contribute my two cents. In this project i applied some of the skills like software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning skills that i learnt to analyze corona virus trends. 

File Description:-
There are three main folders:

Datasets
	cases_country.csv - This sheet has details of latest snapshot of covid-19 cases, deaths globally
	cases_time.csv - This sheet has details of details of confirmed cases per country starting 1/22
	time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv - This sheet has details of confirmed cases in USA
	time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv - This sheet has details of confirmed cases in USA
models
	weights-improvement-975-0.00.hdf5- This file is the model trained using keras for confirmed corona virus cases
models2
